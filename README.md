## Ruke's Emporium (v2)

Ruke's Emporium (v2) is a redesign of a project I completed during my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program. For this project, I designed an e-commerce website in React. With barely a week of React training and one week to complete the project, you can imagine how simple this project was. I truly did not understand the power of React. 

Having time to dedicate to studying React and its multitude of libraries, I have created a newer version of the site. Utilizing both function and class components, as well as newer features in the react-router-dom such a nested routes, I was able to build the site I had envisioned when I first sketched this project on paper. Now, instead of all pieces of my application residing in a mere handful of files, I have built reusable components that not only benefited this particular project, but are reusable for future designs as well. 

For this version I utilized a new system: Firebase. Firebase allowed me to encompass user authentication as well as a robust database for the products within my site all under one umbrella. While it was a tough journey digging through Googleâ€™s documentation for Firebase, I am glad I put in the time. I was also able to implement a payment system (utilizing Stripe) which time constraints prevented me from achieving in the original.
